## Introduction

I really like the [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/). 
It’s an easy to learn time management method which helps you getting things done (GTD), stay focused and be more productive. 
See also [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

I wanted to use a Pomodoro Timer while doing work on my computer but I didn't find a suitable application, so I wrote one.

My personal requirements:
* I manage my tasks via good old fashioned pen & paper -> So I just need a simple timer application, to task managemend bloat ware.
* The timer needs to stay in my sight on the screen at all times. So I get into the Eustress Phase (Positive Stressor) and be highly productive. -> No web app, need a native desktop application.


## Software-Features
* One Click start of the timer. After 25 minutes have passed, another click starts the break. 
* App is highly (geometric) scalable and can be “parked” in free areas anywhere on the screen.
* Visual Feedback with color changing time bar
* Stays always on top of other applications
* Remembers window position and size upon next start (most other application don't do that - found this quite annoying).

## Software Installation
Software needs the [.net Standard Framework 4.5 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework). Most Windows PCs have this installed by default.

Just download and start the PomodoroTimer.exe.

## Remarks
The Software doesn’t play a ringing sound after the Pomodoro / Break. This is done on purpose because it annoyed me (and sometimes others).  

*If the software helps you or you have some questions, I love to hear your feedback*
