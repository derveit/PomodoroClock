## Introduction

I really like the [Pomodoro Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/). 
It’s an easy to learn time management method which helps you getting things done (GTD), stay focused and be more productive. 
See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) or many YouTube videos.

I wanted to use a Pomodoro Timer while doing work on my computer but I didn't find a suitable application, so I wrote one.

My personal requirements:
* I just need a simple timer application, no task management bloat ware. (My task management is done via pen & paper)
* To stay highly productive, the timer needs to be in sight at all times ("OMG, only 4 minutes left", positive stress also called "Eustress") -> A seperate browser window doesn't do the job, it has to be a desktop application. 
* I didn't not want to use a phone timer. 1st reason is that I don't want to be distracted by incoming phone messages and 2nd reason that I don't want to be disturbed by the "ringing" sound.

## Software-Features
* One click start of the timer. After 25 minutes have passed, another click starts the break. Focus on the task, not the timer software.  
* App is highly (geometric) scalable and can be “parked” in free areas on the screen. Anywhere you need it.
* Easy to recognize visual Feedback via a color changing time bar.
* Remembers window position and size upon next start (most other application don't do that - found this quite annoying).
* Pomodors cannot be paused. That's not a bug, it's the underlying technique.
* After 25 minutes you can start your 5 minute pause. Reason is that you often work a few seconds more than excat 25:00 minutes.

## Software Installation
Software needs the [.net Standard Framework 4.5 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework). Most Windows PCs have this installed by default.

Just download and start the PomodoroClock.exe or compile it by yourself. 
If Windows brings a Security Warning with the exe, then click on the small link "Further Information" and "Execute anyways" -> Reason is that I didn't sign the application.

## Remarks
The Software doesn’t play a ringing sound after the Pomodoro / Break. This is done on purpose because it annoyed me (and sometimes others).  

*If the software helps you or you have some remarks, I'd love to hear your feedback*
